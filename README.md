# Scrimba - Learn React Course Projects (Vite Setup)

This repository contains my personal solutions, notes, and project builds completed while taking **Bob Ziroll's** excellent ["Learn React"](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e) course on Scrimba.

This course is designed as the ultimate React 101 experience, guided by **MDN Web Docs**. It focuses on modern React basics through **170+ interactive coding challenges** and **6 projects**, aiming to build confidence for creating real-world applications.

**Key Difference:**
While the Scrimba course utilizes a built-in interactive code editor, all the exercises and projects within this repository were developed using a **local development environment configured with Vite**. This means manually setting up the React environment, handling dependencies, and running a local development server for each project or section, offering a different perspective on the development workflow compared to the integrated Scrimba experience.
